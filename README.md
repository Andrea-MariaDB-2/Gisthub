# GistHub

![](http://i.imgur.com/2DriSix.png)

This Chrome extension fixes a personal annoyance of mine: the top-left logo on the [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) site takes to Gist home, instead of GitHub home.
This extension splits the logo into two hyperlinks: clicking on **GitHub** part takes to github.com, while clicking on **Gist** takes to gist.github.com.
